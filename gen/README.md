# About

This folder contains a program to generate synthetic data for training.

It produces PBR based images which come with annotations and segmentation.

This data can then be used to prototype:

 - object detection
 - image segmentation
 - denoisers

### Models

There are several 3D models used in this program.
Some of them are developed by a third party.
Those are:

 - `buddha.stl` from [McGuire Computer Graphics Archive](https://casual-effects.com/data/)
 - `bunny.stl` from [McGuire Computer Graphics Archive](https://casual-effects.com/data/)
 - `dragon.stl` from [McGuire Computer Graphics Archive](https://casual-effects.com/data/)
 - `monkey.stl` from [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
 - `teapot.stl` from [McGuire Computer Graphics Archive](https://casual-effects.com/data/)
